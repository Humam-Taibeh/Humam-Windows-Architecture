# Changelog

All notable changes to **Humam Windows Architecture** are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Versioning note: the GUI application and the PowerShell core are versioned
independently (GUI `APP_VERSION` in `src/frontend/main.py`, core
`$Script:ScriptVersion` in `src/backend/core.ps1`). Releases below track the
GUI version, with core changes called out explicitly.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Complete repository meta-file overhaul: rewritten `README.md`, comprehensive
  `.gitignore`, added `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`,
  `.editorconfig`, `.gitattributes`, and GitHub issue/PR templates.
- `requirements.txt` cleaned up: removed the unused `customtkinter` dependency
  (the GUI is pure PySide6); build tooling moved to `requirements-dev.txt`.
- `main.spec` (PyInstaller build recipe) is now version-controlled.

---

## [5.1] — 2026-07-07

### Added
- **PySide6 (Qt 6) frontend** replacing the earlier CustomTkinter prototype:
  frameless glass-morphism window, dual light/dark themes with live switching,
  60 fps motion system (glow, shimmer, cascade, page fade), live task console,
  and toast notifications.
- **Modular frontend blueprint** — menu data (`menu_structure.py`), design
  tokens (`theme.py`), motion (`animations.py`), components (`widgets.py`),
  and threading utilities (`utils/helpers.py`) fully separated from the
  orchestrator (`main.py`).
- **Per-app checkbox selector** for winget catalogs — install only the apps
  you tick.
- **System insights dashboard** — OS build, CPU, and RAM read via registry
  and kernel32 with zero third-party dependencies.
- **One-file PyInstaller distribution** (`main.spec`) bundling the GUI and
  the PowerShell core into a single elevated, windowed executable.

### Fixed
- Qt thread-safety: PowerShell now runs on a `QThread` and reports back
  exclusively through Qt signals — widgets are never mutated from a
  background thread.
- Non-interactive guard: when dispatched from the GUI, the core never blocks
  on console input or pops browser/Store windows mid-run.

### Core (PowerShell v3.3 → v3.4)
- New **Safety & Recovery** hub: one-click rollback to the session restore
  point, *Reset ALL Tweaks*, *Restore All Services*, and an in-app log viewer.
- Every reversible tweak snapshots its **original** value before changing
  anything, so resets restore your real prior settings.
- Automatic System Restore point before the first system change of any
  session, across all modules.
- Edge removal backs up Preferences/Bookmarks/Favicons; OneDrive removal
  offers a Desktop backup first.
- Failed operations (SFC/DISM, Edge removal/reinstall, restore points) can be
  retried in place.

## [1.0] — 2026-07-06

### Added
- Initial release: data-driven PowerShell deployment & optimization framework
  (`core.ps1`) with a self-elevating launcher, hierarchical terminal menu,
  winget-based software deployment, registry tweak engine, SFC/DISM repair
  automation, privacy hardening, and session logging.
